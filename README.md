# What is herd immunity?
Herd immunity, or community immunity, happens when a sufficient proportion of a population (the percentage varies by disease) is immune to an infectious disease through vaccination or prior illness to make its spread from person to person unlikely, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Even individuals not vaccinated (such as newborns and those with contraindications for the vaccines) are offered some protection because the disease has little opportunity to spread within the community.

# What is an example of herd immunity?
Measles provides a good example. It is a highly contagious infectious disease for which we have very effective vaccines. Public health experts say if 93-95% of the population is immune to measles, a feasible target with the available vaccine, then that will protect the entire population.

This herd or community immunity acts as a barrier against the disease, with the immune people breaking the potential chain of transmission so those vulnerable populations are unlikely to get it.

# How close are we to herd immunity for COVID-19?
Experts estimate that herd immunity would require around 80-90% of the population to have COVID-19 immunity, either through prior infection or vaccination. That's why experts are encouraging the public to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

“We have not achieved any herd immunity through a natural disease process to most major infectious diseases that affect the population to this scale,” said Christelle Ilboudo, MD, infectious disease expert at MU Health Care. “All of the major infections I know of have required vaccination.”
